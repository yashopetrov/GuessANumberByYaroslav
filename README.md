If players input is below the target the program returns a message that the number is too low. If players input is above the target the program returns a message that the number is too high. If the player enters an invalid input (not a digit) the program returns a message that the input is invalid. If the player guess the number the program returns a message that the number is correct and the player can continue to next level.
